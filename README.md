The ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) - Simple tutorial

What is ETL?

The ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process involves extracting data from a source system, transforming it to meet the desired format or structure, and loading it into a target system.

What does the code do?

The code extracts data from the source Excel file, applies several transformations and saves the transformed data to a new Excel file in the load phase. The ETL process can be expanded to handle more complex data transformations, integration with multiple data sources, and loading into various target systems.
